## User Stories for Trivia Wizard Game

#### User
* As a user, I want my high score and average score to be recorded and displayed to me whenever I return to the index page.

* As a user, I want to be challenged by questions of different and generally increasing difficulty levels.

* As a user, I want to answer a series of random questions. I have to answer the questions correctly to move on to the next question. The questions will get harder as the game progresses. 

* As a user, I want to be presented with an intuitive experience of the question and possible answers. 

* As a user, I want a clear explanation of what options I have as far as lifelines so that I can use them wisely.

* As a user, I want to have a dramatic moment to find out if my submitted answer is correct or not, instead of finding out right away (instantaneously).

* As a user, I want to see a variety of questions, not just answer after reading passages.


#### Developer
* As a developer - I want to create an application that asks a series of random questions. The user will have to select the correct answer to move on to the next question. The questions will get a little more difficult as the user gets questions correct. 

* As a developer, I want to create different question levels by assigning questions a difficulty level as a property of the object instance.

* As a developer, I want the user data to be stored locally so that we can address them by name and have their previous scores available to display. 

* As a developer, I want the answers to be displayed in a random order each time so that nothing is given away by the position of the answer (A, B, C, D).

* As a developer, I want to implement a fake database searching effect for 3 seconds before letting users know if the submitted answer is correct or not.

* As a developer, I want to implement at least a couple interactive video questions (users have to answer after watching a video).

#### Data Analyst
* As a data analyst, I want to see what users are likelier to play the game most. I want to gather data on how many questions are answered correctly and which ones are incorrect.
